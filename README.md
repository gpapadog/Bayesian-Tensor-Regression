# Bayesian-Tensor-Regression
This article proposes a Bayesian approach to regression with a scalar response on vector and tensor
covariates. Vectorization of the tensor prior to analysis fails to exploit the structure,
often leading to poor estimation and predictive performance. We introduce a novel class
of multiway shrinkage priors for tensor coefficients in the regression setting and present
posterior consistency results under mild conditions. A computationally efficient Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for posterior computation. Simulation studies
illustrate substantial gains over existing tensor regression methods in terms of estimation
and parameter inference. Our approach is further illustrated in a neuroimaging application.
